Scenario  You have chartered a yacht with N friends N depends on your team size ,  for the holiday trip of a lifetime across the Atlantic Ocean. Because none of  you have any previous sailing experience, you have hired an experienced  skipper and two-person crew.  Unfortunately in mid Atlantic a fierce fire breaks out in the ships galley and  the skipper and crew have been lost whilst trying to fight the blaze. Much of  the yacht is destroyed and is slowly sinking.  Your location is unclear because vital navigational and radio equipment  have been damaged in the fire. Your best estimate is that you are many  hundreds of miles from the nearest landfall.  You and your friends have managed to save 15 items, undamaged and  intact after the fire. In addition, you have salvaged a 6 person rubber life  craft and a box of matches.  Your task is to rank the 15 items in terms of their importance for you, as you  wait to be rescued.  1. Place the number 1 by the most important item, the number 2 by the  second most important, and so on through to number 15 for the least  important Your Rank A 10 minutes .  

2. Invite everyone to get into groups of 6. Encourage the group to discuss  their individual choices and work together to agree on a collaborative list.  Record the group rankings in the second column Group Rank B 20  minutes .  

3. Once the expert rankings are provided to you Expert Rank C , compute  the absolute difference between Your Rank and Expert Rank A C  and Group Rank and Expert Rank B C .  

4. Add the values for Your Score and Group Score and note the same at

Contemporaneously described as the  ""war to end all wars"", more than 70 million military personnel, including 60  million Europeans, were mobilised in one of the largest wars in history. An  estimated nine million combatants and seven million civilians died as a direct  result of the war, while it is also considered a contributory factor in a number  of genocides and the 1918 influenza epidemic, which caused between 50 to  100 million deaths worldwide. Military losses were exacerbated by new  technological and industrial developments and the tactical stalemate caused  by gruelling trench warfare. It was one of the deadliest conflicts in history and  precipitated major political changes, including the Revolutions of 1917 1923,  in many of the nations involved.

The Triple Alliance was  primarily defensive in nature, allowing Italy to stay out of the war in 1914,  while many of the terms of both agreements were informal and contradicted  by others for example, Italy renewed the Triple Alliance in 1902 but secretly  agreed with France to remain neutral if it was attacked by Germany. 12 As the  war widened, the Entente added Italy, Japan and eventually the United  States to form the Allied Powers, while the Ottoman  Empire and Bulgaria joined Germany and Austria to create the Central Powers.

The process is often used in the  semiconductor industry to produce thin lms. In typical CVD, the wafer substrate is exposed to one or more volatile precursors, which react  and or decompose on the substrate surface to produce the desired deposit. Frequently, volatile by- products are also produced, which are removed by gas ow through the reaction chamber.
